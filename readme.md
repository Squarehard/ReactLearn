## Base project:


Built with Creat React App

* create React App

  > includes react-scripts.

  react-sripts is a set of scripts from the create-react-app starter pack. create-react-app helps you kick off projects without configuring, so you do not have to setup your project by yourself.

  with create-react-app you have following features out of the box.

  1. React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
  1. Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
  1. Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
  1. A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
  1. A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
  1. A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
  1. An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria.
  1. Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.
